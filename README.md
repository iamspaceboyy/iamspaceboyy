- 👋 Hi, I’m @iamspaceboyy
- 👀 I’m interested in learning new things and I love to code but I only started a few months ago. I graduated last year but then I discoverd that I love coding AND Im actually a fast learner suprisingly!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning in codecademy JavaScript and now starting with my full-stack development course.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects and working with people to achieve team goals and solve real-world problems.

- 😄 Pronouns: He|Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: In School I hated computer science and coding! I always found it boring and complicated but look now...I LOVE IT!
